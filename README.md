# Movie-Recomandation-application

Overview
-This project is a movie recommendation system that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to suggest movies based on user input. It utilizes the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method and cosine similarity to find similarities between movies and provide relevant recommendations.

Features:

-Text-Based Recommendation: The system takes user input of their favorite movie and suggests similar movies from a dataset.
-TF-IDF Vectorization: Text data from movie descriptions, genres, keywords, cast, and director are transformed into TF-IDF vectors for similarity calculations.
-Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between movie vectors and generate recommendations.
-Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned and processed to handle missing values and ensure accurate recommendations.
-Modular Structure: The code is organized into separate modules for data processing and user interaction.

Dataset:

-The system uses a movie dataset in CSV format, containing information about movie titles, genres, keywords, taglines, cast, directors, and more.
